##  Objective

To develop and evaluate machine learning models that can predict the likelihood of student dropout using structured student data.

---

##  Dataset

- **Source:** [Student Dropout Dataset](URL or description)
- **Size:** ~670 samples, 33 features
- **Features include:**
  - Demographic data (age, gender, etc.)
  - Academic history
  - Social and economic background

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

##  Machine Learning Models

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks

Each model is evaluated using standard metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

##  Results

- Best model: **[Insert best-performing model here]**
- Accuracy: **[xx]%**
- Key insights:
  - [Add 1–2 insights, e.g., students with poor attendance were 3x more likely to drop out.]
